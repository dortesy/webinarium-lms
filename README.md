# Webinarium

Welcome to Webinarium, an upcoming e-learning platform tailored for the educational needs of Uzbekistan. Inspired by the likes of Udemy, Webinarium aims to democratize education by allowing anyone to upload their courses and monetize their knowledge.

## Description

Webinarium is built using the powerful Next.js 14 framework, leveraging its full-stack capabilities to deliver a seamless user experience. We employ next-auth for robust authentication processes, Prisma for object-relational mapping, and zod for schema validation, ensuring that our platform stands on a foundation of reliable and secure technologies.

## Why Next.js?

We chose Next.js for its versatility as a React framework, providing both client and server-side functionality which is crucial for a platform with dynamic content like Webinarium. Next.js's support for server-side rendering and static generation makes it the ideal choice for a performant and scalable e-learning solution.

## Current Features

- **User Authentication**: Register, log in, forgot password, and verification processes are in place to secure user access.
- **Multi-Language Support**: With next-intl, we ensure that Webinarium is accessible to a diverse user base, embracing the linguistic variety of our audience.
- **Dashboard Development**: A dedicated space for educators to manage their courses and track their progress.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js 14**: For full-stack capabilities, server-side rendering, and static site generation.
- **Next-auth**: For handling authentication workflows with ease and security.
- **Prisma**: As our ORM of choice for interacting with the database in a type-safe manner.
- **Zod**: To enforce validation schemas within our APIs.
- **React-Hook-Form**: For building performant, flexible, and extensible forms.
- **Typescript**: For adding strong typing to JavaScript, increasing the maintainability and robustness of the code.

## Installation

As the platform is currently under development, detailed installation instructions will be provided once the project reaches a more mature phase.
